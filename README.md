## AWDY?

### Will you add my favorite coin?
Only data that can be obtained dynamically will be included; to request a coin, open an issue with links to sources, i.e., pages/APIs (disclaimer: I still might not add it). If you really want to get on my good side, you can write the crawler yourself; see the classes in `data/_scripts` for a general template; more detailed docs coming soon (disclaimer: probably not).


### The data in the repo is outdated!
That data committed should *not* be taken as the source of truth; it's an arbitrary snapshot. Current data is what's live on the site / at the JSON API.

### Aren't these metrics all potentially misleading?'

[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)
