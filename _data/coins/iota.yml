notes: There is no automatic peer discover in IOTA, so total full nodes is unknown
  since most are not public. Full nodes are recommended to not consider a transaction
  to be confirmed on the IOTA Network until referenced by the "coordinator", a centralized
  node controlled by the IOTA Foundation.
