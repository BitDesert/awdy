notes: Dash uses Masternodes (collateralised full nodes with no or empty wallet, funds
  are kept in local offline wallets) to perform higher level functions (PrivateSend,
  InstantSend and Governance). Masternodes share block rewards with miners via deterministic
  queue. The `# of public nodes` represents the number of active Masternodes.
